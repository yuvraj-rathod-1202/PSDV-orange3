There are different widgets that we can use. Here are some of the key features that make Orange a valuable tool for data analysis, machine learning models, etc.

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Workflow
One of Orange’s biggest strengths is its visual programming interface. Instead of writing code, users can build complex workflows by simply dragging and connecting widgets, making data visualization faster and easier.

### 2. Interactive Data Visualization

Orange comes with pre-built machine learning widgets that allow users to apply algorithms such as:

- **Regression** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- **Clustering** (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)

All these are done without writing any code, allowing users to compare models on different training and testing datasets and evaluate model performance.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
Orange provides many widgets to filter and refine data, making it more convenient for analysis. Orange offers a wide range of data processing tools, including:

- **Filtering missing values**
- **Feature selection**
- **Data transformation**

These tools help users clean their datasets and improve the accuracy of their models.
