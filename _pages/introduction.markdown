<br />
Orange is a powerful and user-friendly tool to visualize data without writing any code. Its drag-and-drop feature makes it easy to use for beginners, and its different features make it very useful. There are different widgets that we can use. Here are some of the key features that make Orange a valuable tool for data analysis, machine learning models, etc.

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Workflow
One of Orangeâ€™s biggest strengths is its visual programming interface. Instead of writing code, users can build complex workflows by simply dragging and connecting widgets, making data visualization faster and easier.

### 2. Interactive Data Visualization
There are various types of visualization tools that Orange provides. Some of them are:

- **Scatter plots**
- **Box plots**
- **Histograms**
- **Heatmaps**
- **Bar plots**

These visualizations help users understand patterns, trends, and relationships in their data.

### 3. Built-in Machine Learning Tools
Orange comes with pre-built machine learning widgets that allow users to apply algorithms such as:

- **Regression** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- **Clustering** (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)

All these are done without writing any code, allowing users to compare models on different training and testing datasets and evaluate model performance.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
Orange provides many widgets to filter and refine data, making it more convenient for analysis. Orange offers a wide range of data processing tools, including:

- **Filtering missing values**
- **Feature selection**
- **Data transformation**

These tools help users clean their datasets and improve the accuracy of their models.
